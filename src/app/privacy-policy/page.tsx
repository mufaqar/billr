                            If you are concerned with how we collect, store, use or disclose your personal information, you may make enquiries or submit a formal complaint to us via email <Link href="#">support@billr.com.au.</Link>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will use reasonable endeavours to address your enquiry or complaint and will endeavour to respond to you within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of your initial enquiry or complaint (to the extent that we feel your complaint is complex or that we require further time to provide a substantive response, we will send you a notice to that effect).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You must provide reasonable assistance to us to allow us to address your enquiry or complaint, including providing us with appropriate information and feedback on request.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you feel your enquiry or complaint has not been adequately addressed by us, you may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or any other appropriate Privacy Commissioner. However, we would advise you to notify us beforehand of why you feel we have not adequately addressed your enquiry or complaint and allow us an opportunity to respond to you.

                        <p>
                            Whilst we will do everything in our power to protect your personal information and ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy, we cannot guarantee the security of your information at all times. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Accordingly, where the security of your information is outside of our control (for example where it is being transmitted to us) we cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Accordingly, you should maintain good internet security practices. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access our services or parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone. If you think that any of your accounts have been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by other users. We’ll never email you to ask for your password or other account login information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further, in the unlikely event that we have reasonable grounds to believe an eligible data breach has occurred (in accordance with the Privacy Act), we will promptly notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and any individual at risk of serious harm. In such circumstances, we will follow our internal Data Breach Response Plan which will facilitate a swift response to the breach and ensure that all our legal obligations are met.
                        </p>
